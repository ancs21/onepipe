Today we're excited to announce the public release of OnePipe, a stream-first developer platform SDK designed specifically for Bun.

## What is OnePipe?

OnePipe is a comprehensive SDK that brings event sourcing, projections, and reactive patterns to TypeScript developers. Built from the ground up for Bun's native capabilities, it provides a fluent builder API for creating:

- **REST APIs** with automatic OpenAPI generation
- **Event Flows** for durable, append-only event streams
- **Projections** for materialized views from event data
- **Signals** for reactive state management
- **Channels** for RPC-style communication

## Why Stream-First?

Traditional request-response architectures work well for simple applications, but they often struggle with:

- **Audit trails** - tracking what happened and when
- **Temporal queries** - understanding state at any point in time
- **Reactive updates** - pushing changes to clients in real-time
- **Distributed systems** - coordinating state across services

OnePipe's stream-first approach addresses these challenges by treating events as the source of truth.

## A Quick Example

Here's how simple it is to build an event-driven API with OnePipe:

```typescript
import { REST, Flow, Projection } from '@onepipe/sdk'
import { serve } from '@onepipe/runtime'

// Define an event flow
const orderEvents = Flow.create('orders')
  .schema({ type: 'string', data: 'object' })
  .build()

// Create a projection from events
const orderStats = Projection.create('order-stats')
  .from(orderEvents)
  .initial({ total: 0, revenue: 0 })
  .reduce((state, event) => ({
    total: state.total + 1,
    revenue: state.revenue + event.data.amount,
  }))
  .build()

// Build a REST API
const api = REST.create('orders')
  .basePath('/api/orders')
  .post('/', async (ctx) => {
    const order = ctx.body()
    await orderEvents.append({ type: 'created', data: order })
    return ctx.created(order)
  })
  .get('/stats', async () => orderStats.get())
  .build()

serve({ port: 3000, rest: [api], flows: [orderEvents] })
```

## What's Next?

We're just getting started. Our roadmap includes:

- Distributed event streaming
- Built-in CQRS patterns
- GraphQL subscriptions
- Kubernetes operators

*Happy streaming!*
